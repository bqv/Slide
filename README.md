## Current project status

I am attempting to port this to Lemmy. No concrete timeline, but progress is being made.

Slide is an open-source, ad-free link aggregator client for Android.

It is based on the [Slide for Reddit](https://github.com/ccrama/slide) app.

Slide is not yet available on the Google Play Store or F-Droid. Instead:

There is a [community for Slide](https://feddit.uk/c/slide), which anybody is
welcome to join.

## Contributing

### Issues

In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using [the issue tracker](https://github.com/bqv/slide/issues).
If you don't see your issue (or you aren't sure), feel free to [submit it!](https://github.com/bqv/slide/issues/new).

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the issue is.
You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

### Translations

~~If you are able to contribute a translation into a language missing from Slide,
or spot any room for improvement in an existing translation, we greatly
appreciate anything you can assist with!~~

~~[The project uses Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/slide-for-reddit),
a platform that allows anybody to contribute to translating the app with as many words at a time as they want.
Crowdin provides a nice interface for translating, and no knowledge of the code is needed.~~

Translation framework not yet set up
